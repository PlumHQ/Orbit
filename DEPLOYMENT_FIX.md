# ðŸš€ Orbit Storybook Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
Components were not loading on https://orbit.plumhq.com/ due to incorrect asset path resolution in production.

## Solution Applied
Added base path configuration in `.storybook/main.ts` to ensure correct asset loading:

```typescript
// Configure base path for production deployment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  config.base = './';
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Storybook with production flag:**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run build-storybook
   ```

2. **Deploy the `storybook-static` folder to your hosting service**

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Components should now load properly
   - Check browser console for any remaining errors
   - Test a few component stories to ensure interactivity

## Additional Troubleshooting

If components still don't load, check:

1. **Server Configuration:**
   - Ensure static files are served correctly
   - Check MIME types for .js and .css files

2. **Browser Console:**
   - Look for 404 errors on asset loading
   - Check for JavaScript execution errors

3. **Content Security Policy:**
   - Ensure CSP allows script execution
   - Add necessary domains to allowlist

## Files Changed
- `.storybook/main.ts` - Added production base path configuration
- This fix ensures relative asset paths work correctly when deployed

## Testing
Your rebuilt Storybook should now work properly at https://orbit.plumhq.com/
